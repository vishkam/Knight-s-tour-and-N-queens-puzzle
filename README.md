# Knight's tour and N queens puzzle solutions
Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application to demonstrate solution for following task.

# A knight's tour 
It's a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed, otherwise it is open.  
 
## The N queens puzzle
It's the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Solutions for this problem exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3.
